Medical Codex Data Pipeline Assignment

https://github.com/hantswilliams/HHA-507-2025/blob/main/assignments/assignment1_medicalcodexes.md

Real-World Context
This assignment simulates actual work you'd do as a data engineer or data scientist in healthcare technology. Companies like Epic, Cerner, or health insurance providers maintain exactly these types of data pipelines to ensure their systems have current medical coding standards.

The skills to develop:

Healthcare data domain knowledge
ETL pipeline development
Data quality validation
File format optimization
Production-ready code practices

Scenario
You are a data scientist at a healthcare software company. Your team maintains updated reference lists of medical codexes that are critical for the company's products. These codexes change regularly, so you need to build a robust data pipeline to keep them current.

Assignment Overview
Create Python scripts that can process each medical codex listed below into standardized CSV format. Your pipeline should handle data cleaning, validation, and format conversion for production use.

Target Medical Codexe:

SNOMED CT (US) - Clinical terminology
ICD-10-CM (US) - Diagnosis codes
ICD-10 (WHO) - International diagnosis codes
HCPCS (US) - Healthcare procedure codes
LOINC (US) - Laboratory test codes
RxNorm (US) - Medication codes
NPI (US) - Healthcare provider identifiers
